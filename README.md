# PAN2_L2
This repository is dedicated to provide materials for the "Programming and Numerical Algorithms 2" lessons of the L2-Physics from Univ. Franche-Comt√©.

Be warned that the files in this repo will be deleted and pushed again progressively to follow the University Schedule each year, and the commit history will be deleted accordingly. This repo is not intended to be a full and self sufficient tutorial and attending the lessons is necessary (practical sessions are mandatory).
